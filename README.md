- Open in pop up view doesn't work
- Hide apps on Home screen doesn't work
- Recents provider doesn't launch sometimes
- Does not support navbar overlay if recents provider is activated
- Empty recents while pressing recents button directly from splitscreen. You have to relaunch one of the previously split apps to fix that.
